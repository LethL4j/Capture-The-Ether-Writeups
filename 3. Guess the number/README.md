As you can see in the `isComplete()` function.
To complete this challenge, the `GuessTheNumberChallenge` contract's balance must be `0`
and then the `isComplete()` function will return `true`.

Solve:
1. Deploy the `GuessTheNumberChallenge` contract on the test network(Goerli) with 1 ether.
2. Call the `guess()` function with `42` parameter and pay 1 ether for bypass checking condition.
3. Call the `isComplete()` function.
