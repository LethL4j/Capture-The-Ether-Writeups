This repository contains my solutions to a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge focused on smart contract vulnerabilities in Solidity, a programming language for writing Ethereum smart contracts. The CTF has been available since 2019 and includes a range of common vulnerabilities that Solidity developers should be aware of, including those found in older versions of the Solidity compiler (0.4.x).

This resource is intended as a guide for beginners who are new to smart contracts.

Prerequisite
- Metamask
- Remix IDE
- Basic Solidity Programming knowledge
