The Capture The Ether has been available since 2019. Any user can deploy the challenge's contracts and solve them via Ropsten testnet.
But for now, the Ropsten testnet has been deprecated since Q4 2022, so the users cannot deploy the contract via the official website. As a result, users need to manually deploy the contract in another IDE.

For beginners, I suggest using a Remix IDE for deploying smart contracts.
And I recommended to solve the problems in order of number.

Prerequisite
- Metamask
- Remix IDE
- Basic Solidity Programming knowledge
