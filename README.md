This repository contains my solutions to Capture The Ether challenges.
The Capture The Ether has been available since 2019. And for now, the Ropsten testnet has been deprecated since Q4 2022, so the users cannot deploy the contract via the
official website. As a result, users need to manually deploy the contract in another testnet.

For beginners, I suggest using a Remix IDE for deploying smart contracts because Remix is a no-setup tool.
And it is recommended to solve the problems in order of number.

Prerequisite
- Metamask
- Remix IDE
- Basic Solidity Programming knowledge
